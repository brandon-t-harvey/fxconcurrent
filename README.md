# fxcommonstoolkit
Toolkit for common non-GUI utility methods and classes that are needed by many applications, but depend on JavaFX

This library was extracted from my commonstoolkit as I realized that I was inadvertantly referencing JavaFX classes due to using observable properties and other facilities that aren't related to GUI or Graphics but nonetheless are packaged in the JavaFX JAR and thus may be off-limits to a lot of clients for various reasons.
